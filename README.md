# Multi-Language Support for BOB's Online Application 📱



## Project Overview📁🖊

Bob's App aims to provide a seamless user experience by integrating multi-language support, catering to the diverse linguistic landscape of India. Currently, the app supports only three languages. Our solution expands this to include all 22-23 official languages of India and dynamically suggests languages based on the user's location.
## Key Features🔑

* Comprehensive Language Support: Integration of all 22-23 official languages of India.
* Location-Based Language Suggestions: Automatic suggestions for languages based on the user's geographical location.
* Default Language Options: Default options will always include English, Hindi, and the major language of the user's region.
## Implementation Details📝🌐

* Language Integration
    * Database Update: Extend the language database to include all 22-23 official languages.
    * Translation Resources: Collect and integrate translation files for each language to ensure full app functionality in multiple languages.
    * Testing: Rigorously test the app in each language to ensure accurate translations and functionality. 

* Location Based Language Suggestions

    * Geolocation Service: Implement a geolocation service to detect the user's location upon app installation or when they change their location settings.
